The Matasano Crypto Challenges... in Javascript!

These are the solutions for the challenges available at http://cryptopals.com/

I decided to choose Javascript since I've been working with node.js for a while.

So far only the first set is solved. I'm not using node.js built-in libraries for some tasks such as
BASE64 encoding / decoding. 

My code is far from being clean and optimized. I took the "get it done fast" approach.
